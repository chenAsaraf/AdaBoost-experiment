# AdaBoost Algorithm


### About the project:
In this project, we implement and use the AdaBoost algorithm.
On a dataset (HC_Body_Temperature) there is a temperature and heart rate and the gender as the label(1 or 2). 
We change the gender into points when men are +1 and women are -1. We create two classes of Rectangles and Circles for the hypothesis. 
then we split the dataset to train and test and we train the AdaBoost algorithm on the train dataset.
We calculate the error on the test dataset, and print the error of the final hypothesis of the test and train dataset
